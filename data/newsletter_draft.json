      "title": "Branded Weddings Take the Spotlight",
      "short_version": "61% of couples say they are open to brand sponsorships \u2014 and venues could be their billboard.",
      "whats_happening": "A recent survey revealed that 61% of Americans would accept a brand-subsidized wedding, especially if it covered 50-75% of their costs. Think: A skincare brand gifting luxury welcome bags, a spirits company sponsoring signature drinks, or even signage and shoutouts mid-ceremony. Gen Z is driving this trend, as they put less emphasis on tradition and more interest in value and novelty. The development is also fueled by increasing costs due to rising inflation and social media's influence on wedding aesthetics.",
      "why_matters": "It opens the door to venue-brand partnerships. If a couple is comfortable having their big day \"brought to you by\", the venue can become a platform. Offering optional brand collabs could set your space apart \u2014 and create new revenue streams without raising rental fees.",

      "content": "In today's competitive wedding market, personalization is what sets standout venues apart.
